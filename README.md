# Supervised-Machine-Learning - Regression
Here we use the Ames Housing dataset, which has 79 features(explanatory variables) and a target variable SalesPrice. This gives us an incredible oppurtunity to do exploratory data analysis, data imputation, model selection and finally predicting the house price which just doesn't depend only on Square feet  of the property!!

Acknowledgments
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. 

I have used the following supervised machine learning algorithms on the datasets
1. Linear Regression - using Gradient Descent
2. Lasso Regression
3. Ridge Reegression
4. Support Vector Regressor
5. KNN Regressor

All of these have been done using Python programming language and Scikit package
